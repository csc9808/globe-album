Here is the comprehensive plan for executing the task of changing the 2D divs city levels to sprite-based 3D elements:

### Plan:
1. **Create Textures for City Markers**:
   - Use the existing city images located in the `assets/city_images/` directory to create textures for each city marker.

2. **Update Marker Creation Logic**:
   - Modify the `createCityMarker` function to create `THREE.Sprite` objects instead of `THREE.Mesh` for the city markers. This will allow the markers to be rendered as 3D sprites.

3. **Positioning and Labeling**:
   - Update the logic for positioning the sprites to ensure they are correctly placed on the globe.
   - Adjust the label positioning logic to work with the new sprite-based markers, ensuring that labels are displayed correctly in relation to the sprites.

4. **Testing**:
   - After implementing the changes, test the application to ensure that the city markers are displayed as 3D sprites and that the labels function correctly.
